**Create fonts by waving in thin air!**

I have *finally* found some time to build a [semi-standalone binary](http://www.mauriciogiraldo.com/lab/bodytype/bodytype.0.1.zip) (Mac OS X 10.6 or better) of [BodyType](http://www.mauriciogiraldo.com/blog/2011/06/29/body-type/), my Kinect-based font creation software. This version supports **only UPPERCASE A-Z and 0-9.** If you want to create more glyphs, [let me know](/contact/). The download includes a README.txt file that, as its name indicates, you *must* read. BodyType v0.1 is dependent in other libraries and programs in order to create your fonts properly and that file explains how to install them. They all should be installed with [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/install.php).

The code is also available for [download in Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/bodytype/).
